hw coding challenge

## About

This is a front end coding challenge completed in less than a work day. The content was built to the design specification of the Hatchway front end assessment.
Some of the code is commented to explain why certain choices were made.

## Getting Started

to run this on your own machine:

1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. run "yarn install" in the client folder.
3. then run "yarn start".

## Technology Choices

- js:react
  - Chose to use hooks instead of traditional components to practice them and because I wasn't sure if I wanted to add in simple global state at the beginning of the project.
- modular CSS & CSS Grid
  - used modular CSS for easy readability and file formatting.
  - leveraged CSS Grid formatting
